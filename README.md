# `crossmint-sdk (beta)`

## You can check the full documentation at [docs.crossmint.com](https://docs.crossmint.com/)

The Crossmint SDK allows you to offer wallet-less credit card purchases on your NFT drop. It takes 5 lines of code and 5 minutes to integrate. It's free to use for the seller. Youâ€™ll get the sales proceeds in SOL/ETH as if the user was paying with their own wallet.

## Get Started

## Build from Source

1. Clone the project:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Crossmint/crossmint-sdk.git
```

2. Use the specified node version in .nvmrc file:
```shell
nvm use
```

3. Install dependencies:

pnpm install
```

4. Build all packages:

```shell
pnpm build
```

5. Run locally:

```shell
cd apps/payments/create-react-app

```

Remember that if doing changes on the `@crossmint/client-sdk-react-ui` package, they wont be reflected into your project until you rebuild the package and install it back again:

```
# Inside `packages/client/ui/react-ui`. Rebuild package
pnpm build
```

```
# Inside the starter. Eg. `packages/client/startes/nextjs-starter`. Install rebuilt package
pnpm install
```

## Publish

1. Locally, run `pnpm change:add` - the CLI will guide you through selecting which packages you want to update + adding a short message for the changelog
2. Commit the generated `changeset` file to your PR
3. The `changeset-bot` will comment on your PR when it detects a new `changeset` has been added
4. Merge your PR, with the `changeset`, to `main`
5. A "Release packages" PR will be created/updated by the `changeset-bot`, detailing the pending updates
6. Merge the "Release packages" PR to main - the new packages will automatically be published on the NPM registry
7. Done!

## (OLD) Publish (for the crossmint team)

```shell
pnpm build
pnpm test
pnpm run lerna version
pnpm build
pnpm run publish
