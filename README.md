# `crossmint-sdk (beta)`

## You can check the full documentation at [docs.crossmint.com](https://docs.crossmint.com/)

The Crossmint SDK allows you to offer wallet-less credit card purchases on your NFT drop. It takes 5 lines of code and 5 minutes to integrate. It's free to use for the seller. Youâ€™ll get the sales proceeds in SOL/ETH as if the user was paying with their own wallet.

## Get Started
